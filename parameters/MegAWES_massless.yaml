# Same as MegAWES but without kite or tether mass. Winch inertia is still the same.

kite:
  CL: 1.8           # lift coefficient [-]
  E: 8.4            # lift-drag ratio exclusive tether [-], qsm.py will calculate tether contribution.
  S_m2: 150.45      # wing reference area [m^2]
  m_kg: 0.0         # mass [kg]
tether:
  rho_kgpm3: 0.0    # tether density [kg/m3]
  r_m: 0.01485      # tether radius [m]
  Cd_t: 1.1         # tether drag coefficient [-]
winch:
  r_m: 0.4          # radius [m]
  J_kgm2: 32.0      # inertia [kgm^2]
  friction: 10.0    # rotational friction coefficient [Nm/(rad/s)]
environment:
